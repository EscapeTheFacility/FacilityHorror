# FacilityHorror
The old LightsOut plugin, remade for EXILED 6 & NWAPI (now including more features!)

### Features
- Customizable "round events" that trigger a certain game event on a random interval.
- You can set up as much events as you want with as much combinations as you want.

### Note:
Currently the following features are different between the EXILED and NWAPI versions:
- `keep_tesla_enabled: false` is broken on the NWAPI version (tesla gates will always be enabled during an event)
